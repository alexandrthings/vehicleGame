# Vehicle Base

This project makes voxel vehicles in Unity and demonstrates an optimized algorithm for generating a mesh and colliders in a single pass.

## Features
- Meshing optimized for small triangle count
- Collisions
- Checking for connected blocks
- Custom GameObject blocks for functional blocks
- Block parameter customization
- Ammo, Fuel, and Energy resource and resource use
- Block loading from XML
- Vehicle save/load from XML
- Armor-piercing damage model

## Block scripts for 
- Fuel Tank 
- Seat
- Turret Ring
- Engine
- Tracks
- Wheels
- Heliblades
- Ammo Rack (incomplete)
- Cannon (incomplete)
